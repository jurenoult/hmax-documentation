# Installation

HMAX is written in [Matlab](https://mathworks.com/). Matlab is a proprietary software so you must have a Matlab licence.

Plus, in order to run HMAX, you must have theses Toolboxes:

| Optimization toolbox                                     |
| Parallel Computing Toolbox (optionnal)                   |
| Global Optimization Toolbox (sparse coding only)         |
